        <div class="desc">A note in a jaggy, hurried handwriting. It says,

"Test is still underway. I have passed the Combat and Teleportation trials, but I can't figure out how to get into the locked chest with the altars around it. I used Divination, but the only answer I got was 'SEWN'.

I still have my secret weapon: a Potion of Brilliance. Will drink it if necessary, but leaving it here for now."</div>
