        <div class="title">"Talerra At The New Moon"</div>
        <div class="desc">A depiction of Talerra, the spectral God of Depression and Knowing the Truth. Her ghostly arm beckons as if she has some bad news to deliver. This painting seems supernaturally resilient, and it has probably been blessed by one of Talerra's few monk-priests. However, it's way too creepy to display in a home.</div>
