        <div class="desc">Written by an anonymous orc, this terse poem tells the story of the battle of Fok, where over a million orcs died. The author manages to deliver a glimpse into the horrors of war. It's said that the author was drawn and quartered for producing this work, and their works burned, but obviously some copies survived.</div>
