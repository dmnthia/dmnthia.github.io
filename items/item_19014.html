        <div class="title">Letter to Landri the Cold</div>
        <div class="desc">It's a note to Landri the Cold, an elf in Kur Mountains. It reads, "You have not met me, and I cannot reveal myself, but I am a fellow theoretician, and I beg your help. I believe I can tap a portal to other planes of existence, and the plane of ice is very accessible here. I intend to use the Galkun technique to open the wormhole, and power it via ordinary ice lichen." (The note goes on for some length, in increasing technical detail, before ending with a perfunctory request for verification of the plan.)</div>
