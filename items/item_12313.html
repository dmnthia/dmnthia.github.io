        <div class="title">"Commentary on Slavery"</div>
        <div class="desc">A hard-hitting book by the goblin poet Kaghat. It approaches the topic of slavery from every angle, and it pulls no punches. It's a very polarizing book in goblin culture. Kaghat herself claims that she was banished from her tribe because of this book, although her tribe vehemently denies this, saying that Kaghat just wandered into the desert one day and never came back.</div>
