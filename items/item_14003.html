        <div class="title">Note to Algid Overseer Winterhue</div>
        <div class="desc">A brief note written in a lovely flowing script. It says,

"Do you remember when your helm was shattered? Probably not. You gave it to me to repair, but it was beyond my skill. I took it to Haetrix, who used inappropriately-strong magic, and now its reality is damaged. Anyway, if your helm disappears in a puff of logic, don't fret. I've locked it in a box for you near the Sun Vale mouth. Gut a troll to light the lamp light, rip the wings off a deviant fae for the second, and rip out the stomach of your least favorite ogre for the third.
